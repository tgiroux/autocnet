   :align: center

   A sample of the AutoCNet library being used for pseudo-dense matching on straight-forward Apollo 15 metric camera images.  Blue points are identified correspondences and yellow lines indicate that the points are linked (correspond with one another).

AutoCNet
========
AutoCNet is an open source library (API) for the pseudo-automated generation of sparse n-image
control networks.  AutoCNet is licensed in `the public domain`_.

AutoCNet supports the following:

- 32-bit CUDA based (GPU) keypoint extraction
- Support for images of arbitrary size using downsampling or tiling for feature extraction
- A reference implementation (the CandidateGraph) to demonstrate use of the API
