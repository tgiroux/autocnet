    Given a set of input features and x/y extents lay a regular grid over the area
    defined by the extents and find correspondences within each grid cell that
    does not have any existing correspondences.

    Then number of cells are defined by the n_x/y_cells parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_feats : ndarray
               (n,m) input features with the first column being x-coordinate
               in image space and the second column being y-coordinate.

    ref_feats : np.ndarray
                where the first 2 columns are the x,y coordinates in pixel space,
                columns 3 & 4 are the x,y coordinates in m or km in the same
                reference as the target features

    tar_feats : np.ndarray
                where the first 2 columns are the x,y coordinates in pixel space,
                columns 3 & 4 are the x,y coordinates in m or km in the same
                reference as the reference features

    ref_desc : np.ndarray
               (m, n) where m are the individual SIFT features and
               n are the descriptor length (usually 128)

    tar_desc : np.ndarray
               (m, n) where m are the individual SIFT features and
               n are the descriptor length (usually 128)

    xextent : tuple
              in the form (minx, maxx)

    yextent : tuple
              in the form (miny, maxy)

    ring : tuple
           in the form (min_ring, max_ring)

    n_x_cells : int
                the number of cells to generate in the x direction

    n_y_cells : int
                the number of cells to generate in the y direction

    target_points : int
                    The desired number of points to identify a correspondence
